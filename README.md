## Notes
Thanks to the folks over at [libusb](https://github.com/libusb/libusb) for making their software available for public use. The libusb-1.0 DLL files for 32 and 64 bit Windows have been included here for convenience of anyone using this software. If you need another release of the binary or want to see the source code, you can find them at the Github repo linked above.
