# PyFMS
Field Management System written in Python that can use USB controllers to control LEGO Mindstorms NXT and EV3 bricks over a Bluetooth connection
The system was intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi that is Wifi and Bluetooth enabled. The device I used to develop and test the software was a Raspberry Pi 3B+. Other deivces will probably work (provided they support *nix commands) but I make no guarantees.
